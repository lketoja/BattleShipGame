# BattleShipGame

This game is still in progress!

I wrote the first version of this game one year ago (February 2019). Back then I had just started my journey in coding and didn't know how to write clean code. My methods were super long and I had misterious integer arrays for discribing various things. (I also left the old version here https://github.com/lketoja/Laivanupotus)

After reading Practical Object-Oriented Design by Sandi Metz and Clean Code by Robert C. Martin, I decided to write a better version of the old BattleShipGame. I wanted to have methods and classes that have only one responsibility. I was able to reduce repetition with template method pattern (enterShips() and playTurn()). I tried to pay attention to loose coupling and law of demeter and dependency injection.

# BattleShipGame

I wrote the first version of this game one year ago (February 2019). Back then I had just started my journey in coding and didn't know how to write clean code. My methods were super long and I had misterious integer arrays for discribing various things.

After reading Practical Object-Oriented Design by Sandi Metz and Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (not finished yet), I decided to write a cleaner version of the old BattleShipGame.
